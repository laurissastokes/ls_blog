I have no idea what this website will be about. I just felt like learning to how to make a website. I was inspired by [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#authoring-in-markdown-). Maybe one day I'll spruce it up and put some content on it. Maybe its content will offer some thoughts about why only philosophers and historians could make math and computer programming seem interesting and accessible to me. But, for now, I'm off to learn about Python!!
